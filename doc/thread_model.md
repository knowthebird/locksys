# üîê LockSys Threat Model

This document outlines key threats, assumptions, and mitigations for the LockSys access
control system. It is intended to guide development and integration in secure environments,
especially where physical access control is critical.

---

## üìå Overview

**LockSys** is a modular, platform-agnostic access control framework designed for embedded
and general-purpose systems. It is optimized for microcontrollers but portable to Linux,
Windows, and platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

Primary use cases include physical locks for:
- Safes
- Lockers
- Vending machines
- ATMs
- Vaults
- Automotive systems
- Physical access doors

LockSys uses cryptographic primitives (e.g., HMAC) to secure PIN data and potentially
prevent replay attacks, but it is not a general-purpose encryption or secure storage library.

---

## üß± Architecture

- LockSys exposes a small public API through `locksys.h`.
- Users implement a platform-specific HAL to connect LockSys to their hardware.
- Integrators are expected to wrap LockSys with higher-level UX or application code.
- LockSys does not assume responsibility for the physical integrity of the signal path to
  the actuator; if the unlock signal is bypassed on the PCB, the system is compromised.

---

## üöÄ Deployment Assumptions

- LockSys runs on physical hardware (MCUs or embedded computers).
- If an attacker can access the PCB, they are assumed to have access to the unlock line.
- Encryption of user data protects PIN confidentiality in the case of theft or data dumping.
- Replay protection and secure transport may be required in some input configurations.
- Dumping firmware, RAM, or EEPROM is considered a physical attack and out of scope,
  though input validation is used to resist logic-based tampering.
